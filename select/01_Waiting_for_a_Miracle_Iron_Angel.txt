Here we are
Black among the stars
We bring the end to mother earth
Contemplate
Architects of hate
Stand in shock for all that you observe

We can't erase the past
All that we've done
What can we do
What will become

Cities drowning in pollution
See the world is going down
What is mankind's own solution
Waiting for a miracle
Searching for a sign
Waiting for A miracle
Running out of time

Deviance
Slain by ignorance
The light is fading day by day
God's delight
A worldwide suicide
Tears of blood will wash our sins away

We can't erase the past
What have we done

Cities drowning in pollution
See the world is going down
What is mankind's own solution
Waiting for a miracle
Searching for a sign
Waiting for a miracle
Running out of time
Waiting for a miracle
Cursing all divine
Waiting for decline...
