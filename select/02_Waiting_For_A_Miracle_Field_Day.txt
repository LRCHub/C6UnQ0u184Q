We spoke in so many words
I don't know
I don't know just where it began
She said
That I better take the recommended dose
I took
I took enough to kill a horse

Now I'm the one to blame
Yeah I'm the one to blame

We stopped waiting for a miracle
We stopped
we wait
We shift but so did everything
Revealed our everything
So here is everything
We won't walk away
We won't walk away

Outside
Outside I'm waiting for a cab
We knew
We knew it would come to nothing
She said that I better take the recommended dose
I took
I took enough to kill a horse

Now I'm the one to blame
Yeah I'm the one to blame
Now I'm the one to blame
I'm the one to blame

We stopped waiting for a miracle
We stopped, we wait
we shift but so did everything
Revealed our everything so here is everything
We won't walk away
We won't walk away

We stopped waiting for a miracle
We stopped, we wait, we shift but so did everything
Revealed our everything so here is everything
We won't walk away
We won't walk away
We won't walk away
We won't walk away
